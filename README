Sometimes I use Ctrl-] a few times to read some code, perhaps navigating up
and down in the files I visit.  Then I want to get back to where I was
before, but Ctrl-O may require a lot of hits.

Here we introduce an alternative, that goes back to the previous file, not
the previous position.  The default mapping is on C-U.

If you would rather go back to the last piece of code you were editing, see
last_edit_marker.vim

BUG TODO: If there is no previous buffer, will loop forever!  We could check
to see if we don't move at all, then abort.
